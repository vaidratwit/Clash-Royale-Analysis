# Predicting Clash Royale Wins Through Deck Composition
This project examines how Clash Royale deck structure influences match outcomes using a historical card-level dataset from Kaggle. Although the dataset comes from an older version of the game, the core mechanics such as elixir management, card synergy, and the interaction between troops and spells still support meaningful exploratory analysis and predictive modeling.
The purpose of this work is to understand why certain decks perform better than others and to build a logistic regression model that predicts the likelihood of winning based on features like average elixir cost, card types, and combined card statistics.
